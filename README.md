***What is Git?***

Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to keep track of changes in your code and collaborate with others. It provides a history of all modifications, making it easy to:
  - Undo changes.
  - Work on multiple features simultaneously.
  - Collaborate with teammates on the same project.
  - Manage code in a structured way.

***Installing Git***

Before you can start using Git, you need to install it on your computer. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system:
  + Installing Git on Windows
  + Installing Git on macOS
  + Installing Git on Linux


***Configuring Git***

After installing Git, set your username and email address to identify your commits. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands, replacing <your-name> and <your-email> with your information: `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
`git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"`


***Creating a New Repository***

To start version controlling a project, create a new Git repository:
1. Navigate to your project's directory.
2. Run the following commands: `git init`

***Cloning a Repository***

If you want to work on an existing Git project, clone it to your computer: `git clone <repository-url>` #Replace <repository-url> with the URL of the repository you want to clone.

***Adding and Committing Changes***

1. Make changes to your project's files.
2. Stage your changes for commit: `git add .`
3. Commit your changes with a descriptive message: `git commit -m "Your commit message"`
   
***Pushing Changes to a Remote Repository***

To share your changes with others on a remote Git repository (e.g., GitHub or GitLab): `git push origin <branch-name>` #Replace <branch-name> with the name of the branch you want to push.

***Pulling Changes from a Remote Repository***

To get the latest changes from a remote repository: `git pull origin <branch-name>` #Replace <branch-name> with the name of the branch you want to pull.

***Branching and Merging***

Branches allow you to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. To create and merge branches:
  1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b <new-branch-name>`
  2. Switch to an existing branch:`'git checkout <existing-branch-name>`
  3. Merge changes from one branch into another: `git checkout <target-branch>` `git merge <source-branch>`
